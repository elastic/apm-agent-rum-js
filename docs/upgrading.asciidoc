== Upgrading
Upgrades between minor versions of the agent, like from 3.1 to 3.2 are always backwards compatible.
Upgrades that involve a major version bump often come with some backwards incompatible changes.

Before upgrading the agent, be sure to review the:

* <<release-notes,Agent release notes>>
* {apm-overview-ref-v}/agent-server-compatibility.html[Agent and Server compatibility chart]

The following upgrade guides are also available:

* <<upgrade-to-v5>> - Follow this guide to upgrade from version `4.x` to version `5.x` of the
Elastic APM RUM JS Agent.

[[end-of-life-dates]]
=== End of life dates

We love all our products, but sometimes we must say goodbye to a release so that we can continue moving
forward on future development and innovation.
Our https://www.elastic.co/support/eol[End of life policy] defines how long a given release is considered supported,
as well as how long a release is considered still in active development or maintenance.
The table below is a simplified description of this policy.

[[upgrade-to-v5]]
=== Upgrade to version 5.x

Upgrading from version `4.x` to `5.x` of the RUM Agent introduces some breaking changes.
This guide outlines the changes and the steps required to upgrade.

[float]
[[v5-breaking-changes]]
=== 5.0 Breaking changes

*Agent name changed to `rum-js`*

The Agent name has been changed to `rum-js`.
Because older versions of the APM app in Kibana don't recognize this new name,
you may need to upgrade your Elastic stack version.

*Official W3C tracecontext support*

The RUM Agent supports the official W3C tracecontext `traceparent` header,
instead of the previously used `elastic-apm-traceparent` header.
If you're using Elastic backend agents,
you must upgrade them to a version that also supports the official W3C tracecontext headers.

*`addTags` replaced with `addLabels*

`addTags`, which was deprecated in version `4.1`, has been removed and replaced with `addLabels`,
which supports strings, booleans, and numbers:

* `apm.addTags()` removed in favor of <<apm-add-labels>>.
* `span.addTags()` removed in favor of <<span-add-labels>>.
* `transaction.addTags()` removed in favor of <<transaction-add-labels>>.

*Single queue processing*

A single queue is now used to process all events (transactions, errors, etc.).
This change allows the consolidation of four configuration options into one:

Removed options:

* `errorThrottleLimit`
* `errorThrottleInterval`
* `transactionThrottleLimit`
* `transactionThrottleInterval`

Added option:

* <<events-limit>> -- Configure the number of events sent to APM Server per minute. Defaults to `80`.

==== Upgrade APM Server

Version `5.x` of the RUM Agent requires APM Server version >= `7.0`.
The {apm-server-ref-v}/upgrading-to-70.html[APM Server `7.0` upgrade guide] can help with the upgrade process.

NOTE: APM Server version >= `7.0` requires Elasticsearch and Kibana versions >= `7.0` as well.
