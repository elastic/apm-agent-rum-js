=== Angular integration

This document covers how to use Real User Monitoring JavaScript agent with Angular applications.

[[angular-supported-versions]]
==== Supported versions

This integration supports Angular versions â‰¥ 9.0.

[[installing-angular-integration]]
==== Installing Elastic APM Angular package

Install the `@elastic/apm-rum-angular` package as a dependency to your application:

[source,bash]
----
npm install @elastic/apm-rum-angular@alpha --save
----

NOTE: If you are using an Angular version < 9.0, use @elastic/apm-rum-angular 1.x to instrument your application. Details are available in a https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/agent/rum-js/4.x/angular-integration.html[prior release].

==== Instrumenting your Angular application

The Angular integration packages exposes the `ApmModule` and `ApmService` which uses Angular's dependency injection
pattern and will start subscribing to https://angular.io/api/router/Event[Angular Router Events] once the service is initialized.

`ApmService` must be initialized from either the application module or application component since
the RUM agent has to start capturing all the resources and API calls as soon as possible.


[source,js]
----
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core'
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser'
import { Routes, RouterModule } from '@angular/router'
import { ApmModule, ApmService } from '@elastic/apm-rum-angular'

const routes: Routes = [
  { path: 'contact', component: ContactListComponent },
  { path: 'contact/:id', component: ContactDetailComponent }
]

@NgModule({
  imports: [ApmModule, BrowserModule, RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],
  declarations: [AppComponent, ContactListComponent, ContactDetailComponent],
  providers: [ApmService],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule {
  constructor(service: ApmService) {
    // Agent API is exposed through this apm instance
    const apm = service.init({
      serviceName: 'angular-app',
      serverUrl: 'http://localhost:8200'
    })

    apm.setUserContext({
      'username': 'foo',
      'id': 'bar'
    })
  }
}
----

Once the service is initialized, both page load and Single page application navigation events will be captured
as transactions with the `path` of the route as its name and `page-load` or `route-change` as type.

==== Capturing errors in Angular applications

By default, when an error is thrown inside the Angular application, the default error handler prints
the error messages to the console without rethrowing them as browser events.

`ApmErrorHandler` provides a centralized error handling which captures and reports the errors
to be shown in the `APM UI` and also logs them to the browser console.


[source,js]
----
import { ErrorHandler } from '@angular/core'
import { ApmErrorHandler } from '@elastic/apm-rum-angular'

@NgModule({
  providers: [
    {
      provide: ErrorHandler,
      useClass: ApmErrorHandler
    }
  ]
})
class AppModule {}
