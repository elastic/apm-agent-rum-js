[[configuration]]
== Configuration

While initializing the agent you can provide the following configuration options:

[float]
[[service-name]]
=== `serviceName`

* *Type:* String
* *Required*

Your Elastic APM service name.

[float]
[[server-url]]
=== `serverUrl`

* *Type:* String
* *Default:* `http://localhost:8200`

The URL used to make requests to the APM Server.

[float]
[[service-version]]
=== `serviceVersion`

* *Type:* String


The version of the app.
This could be the version from your `package.json` file,
a git commit reference,
or any other string that might help you pinpoint a specific version. 
Furthermore this option is used on the APM Server to find the right sourcemap file to apply to the stack trace.


[float]
[[active]]
=== `active`

* *Type:* Boolean
* *Default:* `true`

A boolean specifying if the agent should be active or not.
If active,
the agent will send APM transactions and track errors.
This option can be used to deactivate the agent in your staging environment.
It can also be used to sample a number of clients, here is an example to sample 10% of the page loads:


[source,js]
----
var options = {
  active: Math.random() < 0.1
}
----

[float]
[[instrument]]
=== `instrument`

* *Type:* Boolean
* *Default:* `true`

A boolean specifying if the agent should automatically instrument the application to collect 
performance metrics for the application. 

NOTE: Both active and instrument needs to be true for instrumentation to be running.

[float]
[[disable-instrumentations]]
=== `disableInstrumentations`

* *Type:* Array
* *Default:* `[]`

A list of instrumentations which can be disabled. When disabled, no transactions/spans will be created for that type.
Valid options:

* `page-load`
* `history`
* `eventtarget`
* `xmlhttprequest`
* `fetch`
* `error`

NOTE: To disable all `http-request` transactions, you should add both `fetch` and `xmlhttprequest`.
to this config.

NOTE: To disable `user-interaction` transactions, you should add `eventtarget` to this config.

[float]
[[environment]]
=== `environment`

* *Type:* String
* *Default:* `''`

Environment where the service being monitored is deployed, e.g. "production", "development", "test", etc.

Environments allow you to easily filter data on a global level in the APM app.
It's important to be consistent when naming environments across agents.
See {apm-app-ref}/filters.html#environment-selector[environment selector] in the APM app for more information.

NOTE: This feature is fully supported in the APM app in Kibana versions >= 7.2.
You must use the query bar to filter for a specific environment in versions prior to 7.2.

[float]
[[log-level]]
=== `logLevel`

* *Type:* String
* *Default:* `'warn'`


Set the verbosity level for the agent.
Note that this does not have any influence on the types of errors that are sent to the APM Server.
This option is useful when you want to report an issue with the agent to us.

Possible levels are: `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`.

[float]
[[api-version]]
=== `apiVersion`

* *Type:* number
* *Default:* `2`

Denotes the version of APM Server's intake API. Setting this value to any number
above `2` will compress the events(transactions & errors) payload sent to the server.

NOTE: This feature requires APM Server >= 7.8. Setting this flag to number > 2 with older
APM server version would break the RUM payload from reaching the server.

[float]
[[breakdown-metrics]]
=== `breakdownMetrics`

* *Type:* Boolean
* *Default:* `false`

Enable/disable the tracking and collection of breakdown metrics for the transaction.

NOTE: This feature requires APM Server and Kibana >= 7.4. Setting this flag to `true` with older APM server version
would break the RUM payload from reaching the server.

NOTE: Breakdown distribution for the transaction varies depending on the type of the transaction.
To understand the different types, see <<breakdown-metrics-docs>>

[float]
[[flush-interval]]
=== `flushInterval`

* *Type:* Number
* *Default:* `500`

The agent maintains a single queue to record transaction and error events when they are added.
This option sets the flush interval in *milliseconds* for the queue.

NOTE: After each flush of the queue, the next flush isn't scheduled until an item is added to the queue.

[float]
[[page-load-trace-id]]
=== `pageLoadTraceId`

* *Type:* String

Use this option to override the page load transaction's trace ID.


[float]
[[page-load-sampled]]
=== `pageLoadSampled`

* *Type:* String

Use this option to override the page load transaction's sampled property.


[float]
[[page-load-span-id]]
=== `pageLoadSpanId`

* *Type:* String

This option overrides the ID of the span that is generated for receiving the initial document.

[float]
[[page-load-transaction-name]]
=== `pageLoadTransactionName`

* *Type:* String

This option sets the name for the page load transaction. By default, transaction names for hard (page load) and soft (route change) navigations are
inferred by the agent based on the current URL. Check the <<custom-transaction-name,custom initial page load transaction names>>
documentation for more details.


[float]
[[distributed-tracing]]
=== `distributedTracing`

* *Type:* Boolean
* *Default:* `true`

Distributed tracing is enabled by default, however you can use this configuration to disable it.


[float]
[[distributed-tracing-origins]]
=== `distributedTracingOrigins`

* *Type:* Array
* *Default:* `[]`

This option can be set to an array containing one or more Strings or RegExp objects and determines which origins should be monitored as part of distributed tracing.
More specifically, this option is consulted when the agent is about to add the distributed tracing HTTP header (`traceparent`) to a request.
Please note that each item in the array should be a valid URL containing the origin (other parts of the url are ignored) or a RegExp object. If an item in the array is a String, an exact match will be performed. If it's a RegExp object, its test function will be called with the request origin. 

[source,js]
----
var options = {
  distributedTracingOrigins: ['https://example.com', /https?:\/\/example\.com:\d{4}/]
}
----

[float]
[[propagate-tracestate]]
=== `propagateTracestate`

* *Type:* Boolean
* *Default:* `false`

When distributed tracing is enabled, this option can be used to propagate the https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/#tracestate-header[tracestate]
HTTP header to the configured origins. Before enabling this flag, make sure to change your <<server-configuration, server configuration>> to avoid
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing errors.

[float]
[[event-throttling]]
=== Event throttling

Throttle the number of events sent to APM Server.

[float]
[[events-limit]]
==== `eventsLimit`

By default, the agent can only send up to `80` events every `60000` milliseconds (one minute).

* *Type:* Number
* *Default:* `80`

[float]
[[transaction-sample-rate]]
==== `transactionSampleRate`

* *Type:* Number
* *Default:* `1.0`

A number between `0.0` and `1.0` that specifies the sample rate of transactions, by default all transactions are sampled.


[float]
[[central-config]]
==== `centralConfig`

* *Type:* Boolean
* *Default:* `false`

This option activates APM Agent Configuration via Kibana.
When set to `true`, the agent starts fetching configurations via the APM Server during the initialization phase.
These central configurations are cached in `sessionStorage`, and will not be fetched again until
the session is closed and/or `sessionStorage` is cleared.
 In most cases, this means when the tab/window of the page is closed.

NOTE: Currently, only <<transaction-sample-rate, transaction sample rate>> can be configured via Kibana.

NOTE: This feature requires APM Server v7.5 or later and that the APM Server is configured with `kibana.enabled: true`.
More information is available in {apm-app-ref}/agent-configuration.html[APM Agent configuration].


[float]
[[ignore-transactions]]
==== `ignoreTransactions`


* *Type:* Array
* *Default:* `[]`

Array containing a list of transactions names that should be ignored when sending the payload to the APM server.
It can be set to an array containing one or more Strings or RegExp objects. If an element in the array is a String, an exact match will be performed. 
If an element in the array is a RegExp object, its test function will be called with the name of the transation.

[source,js]
----
const options = {
  ignoreTransactions: [/login*/, '/app']
}
----

NOTE: Spans that are captured as part of the ignored transactions would also be ignored.


[float]
[[monitor-longtasks]]
==== `monitorLongtasks`

* *Type:* Boolean
* *Default:* `true`

Instructs the agent to start monitoring for browser tasks that block the UI
thread and might delay other user inputs by affecting the overall page
responsiveness. Learn more about <<longtasks, long task spans>> and how to interpret them.
