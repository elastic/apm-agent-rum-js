# Upgrading [upgrading]

Upgrades between minor versions of the agent, like from 3.1 to 3.2 are always backwards compatible. Upgrades that involve a major version bump often come with some backwards incompatible changes.

Before upgrading the agent, be sure to review the:

* [Agent release notes](/release-notes/index.md)
* [Agent and Server compatibility chart](docs-content://solutions/observability/apm/apm-agent-compatibility.md)

The following upgrade guides are also available:

* [Upgrade to version 5.x](/release-notes/breaking-changes.md) - Follow this guide to upgrade from version `4.x` to version `5.x` of the Elastic APM RUM JS Agent.


## End of life dates [end-of-life-dates]

We love all our products, but sometimes we must say goodbye to a release so that we can continue moving forward on future development and innovation. Our [End of life policy](https://www.elastic.co/support/eol) defines how long a given release is considered supported, as well as how long a release is considered still in active development or maintenance. The table below is a simplified description of this policy.
