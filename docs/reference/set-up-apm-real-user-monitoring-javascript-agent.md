# Set up the APM Real User Monitoring JavaScript Agent [getting-started]

To start reporting your web page performance to Elastic APM, you must first [enable the RUM endpoint](docs-content://solutions/observability/apm/configure-real-user-monitoring-rum.md) in your `apm-server` configuration.

Once the APM Server endpoint has been configured, you can:

* [Install the Agent](/reference/install-agent.md)
* [Configure CORS](/reference/configuring-cors.md)
