## 5.11.0 [elastic-apm-rum-javascript-agent-5110-release-notes]
**Release date:** April 20, 2022

### Features and enhancements [elastic-apm-rum-javascript-agent-5110-features-enhancements]

Before this change it was only sending them every interval configurable via `flushInterval`. Unsupported browsers: Firefox, IE11: [#1146](https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-rum-js/pull/1146)

::::{note}
Transactions based on the [supported technologies](/reference/supported-technologies.md) and [custom managed transactions](/reference/custom-transactions.md#custom-managed-transactions) are the only ones taken into account.
::::

* **rum-vue:** Introduce script setup syntax support: [#1194](https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-rum-js/issues/1194)
* Override reuse threshold when redefining a transaction. This will permit the agent not to miss data on slow network connections: [#1196](https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-rum-js/issues/1196)
