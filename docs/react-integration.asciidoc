=== React integration

This document covers how to use Real User Monitoring JavaScript agent with React applications.
Please see our <<getting-started, Getting started guide>> for configuring the Real User Monitoring agent.

==== Installing Elastic APM React package

Install the `@elastic/apm-rum-react` package as a dependency to your application:

[source,bash]
----
npm install @elastic/apm-rum-react --save
----

==== Instrumenting your React application

The React integration package provides two approaches to instrumenting your application:

[float]
===== Instrumenting application routes

To instrument the application routes, you can use `ApmRoute` component provided in the package. 
`ApmRoute` creates a transaction that has the path of the `Route` as its name and has `route-change`
as its type.

NOTE: Currently `ApmRoute` only supports applications using 
https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router[`react-router`] library.

First you should import `ApmRoute` from the `@elastic/apm-rum-react` package:

[source,js]
----
import { ApmRoute } from '@elastic/apm-rum-react'
----

Then, you should replace `Route` components from the `react-router` library
with `ApmRoute`. You can use `ApmRoute` in any of the routes that you would like to monitor,
 therefore, you don't have to change all of your routes:


[source,js]
----
class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <ApmRoute
          exact
          path="/"
          component={() => (
            <Redirect
              to={{
                pathname: '/home'
              }}
            />
          )}
        />
        <ApmRoute path="/home" component={HomeComponent} />
        <Route path="/about" component={AboutComponent} />
      </div>
    )
  }
}
----

NOTE: `ApmRoute` only instruments the route if component property is provided, in other cases, e.g. using `render` or `children` properties, 
ApmRoute will only renders the route without instrumenting it, 
please instrument the individual component using `withTransaction` in these cases instead.

===== Instrumenting individual React components

First you should import `withTransaction` from the `@elastic/apm-rum-react` package:

[source,js]
----
import { withTransaction } from '@elastic/apm-rum-react'
----


Then, you can use `withTransaction` as a function to wrap your React components:


[source,js]
----
class AboutComponent extends React.Component { }
export default withTransaction('AboutComponent', 'component')(AboutComponent)
----


NOTE: `withTransaction` accepts two parameters, "transaction name" and "transaction type". 
If these parameters are not provided, the defaults documented in <<transaction-api, Transaction API>> will be used.


[float]
===== Instrumenting lazy loaded routes

When the route is rendered lazily with components using `React.lazy` or a similar API, it is currently not possible to
auto instrument the components dependencies via `ApmRoute`. To instrument these lazy rendered routes and capture the spans 
associated with the components, you'll need to manually instrument the code with the `withTransaction` API.

[source,js]
----
import React, { Component, Suspense, lazy } from 'react'
import { Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom'
import { withTransaction } from '@elastic/apm-rum-react'

const Loading = () => <div>Loading</div>
const LazyRouteComponent = lazy(() => import('./lazy-component'))

function Routes() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={Loading()}>
      <Switch>
        <Route path="/lazy" component={LazyRouteComponent} />
      </Switch>
    </Suspense>
  )
}

// lazy-component.jsx
class LazyComponent extends Component {}
export default withTransaction('LazyComponent', 'component')(LazyComponent)
----
