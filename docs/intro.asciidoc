[[intro]]
== Introduction

The Elastic APM Real User Monitoring (RUM) JavaScript Agent provides detailed performance metrics and error tracking of your web applications.
It has built-in support for popular platforms and frameworks, and an API for custom instrumentation.

The Agent also supports <<distributed-tracing-guide,distributed tracing>> for all outgoing requests.
This enables you to analyze performance throughout your microservice architecture -- all in one view.

[NOTE]
====
The Elastic APM RUM JavaScript Agent is _not_ compatible with {serverless-docs}[{serverless-full}] -- it cannot send data to the APM endpoint for serverless projects.
