# Set up the APM Real User Monitoring JavaScript Agent

To start reporting your web page performance to Elastic APM, you must first [enable the RUM endpoint](https://docs-v3-preview.elastic.dev/elastic/docs-content/tree/main/solutions/observability/apm/configure-real-user-monitoring-rum) in your `apm-server` configuration.
Once the APM Server endpoint has been configured, you can:
- [Install the Agent](https://docs-v3-preview.elastic.dev/reference/install-agent)
- [Configure CORS](https://docs-v3-preview.elastic.dev/reference/configuring-cors)
