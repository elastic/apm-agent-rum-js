# Using with TypeScript

RUM agent publishes the type definitions for the `@elastic/apm-rum` package via `types` property in `package.json`. If you are importing the package on a TypeScript codebase, you will get automatic code completion, hover info and method signature information on supported platforms (Visual Studio Code, etc)
